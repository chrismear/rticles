Rticles
=======

Rticles is a Rails plugin that allows for web-based editing of legal documents. It lets you create nested, numbered paragraphs, along with intra-document references that remain accurate as paragraphs are inserted, removed and moved.

This is a technology test for [One Click Orgs](http://github.com/oneclickorgs/one-click-orgs/).
